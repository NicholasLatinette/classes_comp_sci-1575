What 1575 - "Data Structures" assignments I could find. In this class, we would be assigned some data structure which we would need to create ourself.
# Note:
I am not claiming 100% ownership of these files. Most of the files here are templates started by T.A.'s for the purpose of having all students have a similar starting place (and to focus the work more to the assignemnt). Most of the work is mine but not all of it.
